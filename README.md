Based on the [ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Setup-ROS-2-with-VSCode-and-Docker-Container.html)

#### How to use
For every new ROS 2 project you want to work on in a containerized dev environment, create a new branch (from main) named after the project. This repo is your workspace directory that you can add your project's source code to (inside a "src" directory). This repo will ignore a "src" directory.
